# Explorer Hidder

I have, for years, a snippet named `Folder Hidder` that does, basically, that:
```css
.nav-file-title[data-path="path/to/file.md"],
.nav-folder-title[data-path="path/to/folder"] {
    display: none;
}
```

Hiding some files I doesn't want to see.

But, managing a snippet have some caveat:
- Renaming the file or the folder will break the snippet, and same for moving
- I need to know the entire path of the file or folder, including insensitive case
- I need to always edit the snippets if I want to hide a new file or folder
- Can't unhide individually (unless using a snippets for each files...)

So, I decided to create a plugin that will manage that for me!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
### Configuration

The settings allow:
- Choosing between to save the CSS in a snippets (in your `.obsidian/snippets` folder) or directly inject the CSS in the page. Use this if, for example, you want to keep the folder hidden without using the plugin (for example with disabling or uninstalling it).
- Creating new rules, based on a string. Using attribute selector, you can hide multiple file or folder at once. For example, to hide all the files in a folder, you can set `[startswith] <PathtoFolder>`. See [CSS attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) for more information.

Each attributes correspond to:

| Attribute   | CSS  | Description                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Exact       | `=`  | Exact match with the string                                                                          |
| Contains    | `*=` | Contains the string                                                                                  |
| Ends with   | `$=` | Ends with the string (suffixe)                                                                       |
| Starts with | `^=` | Starts with (prefix)                                                                                 |
| List        | `~=` | String is a whitespace separated list of words, one of which match exactly                           |
| Subcode     | `|=` | The match can be on exactly the value or can begin with value immediately followed by a hyphen (`-`) |

The setting also display the list of all rules where you can:
- Hide or display individually the files/folders from the explorer or in the bookmarks
- Delete the rules
- For "string" rules, you can edit the attributes. It's not possible for rules added using the file-menu, as they are followed by the path for changes (deleted/renamed/moved).

### Hiding files/folders

To hide a file or a folder, you can right-click on the file/folder in the explorer or in the bookmarks and select `Hide file/folder`. The file/folder will be hidden from the explorer and the bookmarks.

### Display all or hide all

Using the "eye" ribbon button you can enable or disable all the rules. 
- Show all will display all the hidden files/folders (ignoring the rules)
- Hide all will restore the older state (based on the hidden parameters).
